### Dependencies
Required packages can be installed by:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

### Download object dataset
#### 2D objects
Download 2D object icons from [Icons50 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danhendrycks/icons50).

#### 3D objects
Download 3D object meshes from [MuJoCo scanned object dataset](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mujoco_scanned_objects).

### Generate simulation data
Replace ```OBJECT_DIR``` in ```sim/sim_2d.py``` and ```sim/sim_3d.py``` with the directory to object dataset.

Install [v-hacd](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd).

#### 2D
```
bash sim/run_sim_2d.sh
```
#### 3D
```
bash sim/run_sim_3d.sh
```

Note for data generation: Sometimes the object shape or the sampled manipulator shape may have weird shape and thus lead to qhull error when doing convex decomposition. And ray is used to parallelize cpu-based data generation, which sometimes may lead to timeout issues. Therefore, it is expected if you see some timeout error message, this means that the data for this object-manipulator pair is not generated, but it should be fine as long as you see most data is being generated.
